# desitest

This repo contains utilities for cross package testing of DESI code.

`etc/cron_dailyupdate.sh` is run as a cronjob on edison01.nersc.gov;
it calls `desitest.nersc.update` to 'git pull' the master copy of each repo
and run their unit tests, and then it runs the spectro pipeline integration
test (currently in desispec).

In the future, integration tests for the spectro pipeline, quicklook, and
other end-to-end tests could be moved into this repo.
